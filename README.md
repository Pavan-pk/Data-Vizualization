## Vizualization of Global development indicies.
Dataset -  https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/csv/   
The viz tries to plot the contrast of development across regions.
This is a multiline graph to show development from 1980 to 2013, each line depicts a country.
Interactions:  
- Allows selections of multiple regions, each region are associated with a color.  
- Allows to select/deselect all regions.  
- Allows to set the opacity of the graph, to reduce clutter
- Allows to highlight a particular country by either hovering over line/endpoint/name associated with it.
- Allows to show the slow animation through the time for selected regions.
